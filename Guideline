# üåø Final project
_This project plan might change depending on any suggestions or adjustments we need to make along the way. But don't worry, any changes will be kept to a minimum, if there are any at all._

+ The final project involves each group designing a class using provided materials and planning creative activities. Most importantly, **each group required to use at least two coding apps.** Throughout the process, feel free to use additional digital tools, but refrain from introducing any new ones to the audience.
+ The texts are middle school-level story materials, which will be assigned to each group (See below).
+ The language objectives include four language skills: reading, writing, speaking, and listening. You can choose from these to structure your learning activities. However, it is necessary to provide specific examples in each part to clearly demonstrate what language learning is being undertaken and what language skills are being learned. For example, consider various activities such as teaching vocabulary, learning expressions, explaining grammar, reading aloud, essay writing, movie/book reviews, and/or quizzes.
+ To make this presentation more engaging, let's **assign roles**: One of the members should be **the main presenter**, taking the audience through the content; we'll have **a teacher role**, who can provide insights and answer questions, demonstrating instructions for specific activities; and we'll also have **two students roles**, who can actively participate in the given activities, raise potential questions, and share their perspectives. This way, we can ensure that everyone is involved and that we get diverse viewpoints on the topic. (Decide on role assignments within your groups.)
  
## üçÉ Final presentation (6/11, 6/18) 
+ [Schedule: Go to](https://wheelofnames.com/)
+ Class demo: This is a demonstration where you explain how a class is conducted (with concrete examples) to the audience rather than directly teaching the class. In our presentation, the audience consists of fellow teachers, so you just need to summarize as specifically as possible what kind of class is possible with your language applications.

|Date|Groups|Text material|
|--|--|--|
|6/11|G1, G5, G6|Story 1, 5, 6|
|6/18|G2, G3, G4|Story 2, 3, 4|

+ Duration: (max.) 40 minutes (20 minutes presentation + 10 minutes Q&A + 10 minutes evaluation)
+ Format: Each group presents their developed app and its relevance to learning English through text. 
+ Content: Include learning objectives, detailed app features, demonstration, shared link for the audience, expected timeframes for activities, types of activities, instructions for use, etc.
+ Q&A Session: Allow for questions from the audience to clarify any aspects of the presented apps.
